MADRID, Spain -- David Nalbandian battled back to stun world No. 1 Roger Federer
with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. David
Nalbandian celebrates after upsetting Roger Federer in the Madrid Masters final.
The Argentine, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the
Swiss star in that year's season-ending Masters Cup -- also an indoor event.
Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the
U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors. Nalbandian became only the
third player -- and the second this year after Novak Djokovic in Montreal in
August -- to beat the world's top-three players en route to winning a title.
German legend Boris Becker was the first to perform the feat 13 years ago.
Nalbandian ousted second-ranked Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and then
Serbian Djokovic in Saturday's semis. The 25-year-old, who lost in the Madrid
final in 2004, claimed his first triumph on the ATP Tour since May, 2006, on
clay in Portugal. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career
since teaming up with Hernan Gumy. "I'm extremely contented to beat the world
number one. Nalbandian said. "Roger and I have a long history and I think that
influenced the match. "It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the
teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played
incredible, and that of course that helps." Federer added: "He served well, I
was quite surprised with how well he served. "He came back strong and played
well in the end. "He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the
first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didn't miss
any more. I couldn't play way I wanted to. It was a pity, he played a great
tournament.""".replace("\n", " ")
